Description: Multicenter randomized trials involve the collection and analysis of data from numerous study participants across multiple sites. Outliers may be present. To identify outliers, this package examines data at the individual level (univariate and multivariate) and site-level (with and without covariate adjustment). Methods are outlined in further detail in Rigdon et al (to appear).
